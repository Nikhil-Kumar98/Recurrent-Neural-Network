# Recurrent-Neural-Network
Human Activity Classification using Inertial Measurement Data trained Using Recurrent Neural Network

This project aims to develop a machine-learning model capable of classifying five different cooking activities (brownies, pizza, sandwiches, salad, scrambled eggs) based on sensor data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in the CMU-MMAC dataset. This dataset captures motion and orientation data from 38 subjects using a specific IMU sensor (ID 2796) across all subjects. The goal is to accurately predict the prepared recipe by analysing time-series data collected during the cooking process using deep learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1score. The final objective is to achieve classification accuracy on the test dataset and provide comprehensive documentation of the entire process, including insights into the model's effectiveness and any challenges encountered.
